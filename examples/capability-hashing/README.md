# AX Capability Hashing – Python Example (Non-Normative)

This directory contains a simple, illustrative Python script demonstrating
one possible approach to canonicalizing and hashing an AX document for
capability comparison.

This code is:
- Non-normative
- Provided for illustration only
- Not required for AX compliance
- Not a reference implementation

The AX specification defines the hashing semantics; this example demonstrates
how those semantics might be implemented in practice.
